/* Kernel-owned BO mapping transactions of one context bank, not a userspace ABI or GPU scheduler.
 * Attach under the actual bank/ASID/streams of a programmed, routed context (NativeAdrenoSmmuContext::binding) with empty
 * native4K arenas. Attach proves the whole of both regions once (the kit's table audit) and the routes and context through the
 * board's programmer (A830Smmu::verifyRoutes); after it the table transactions read no SMMU register: a map writes leaves and
 * publishes their pages (a clean to PoC, or only dsb ishst once the coherent table walk was proved, ARCHITECTURE 4.6.1/4.14.2),
 * an unmap clears leaves and invalidates their pages (<= 512 by TLBIVAL, else TLBIASID) with one TLBSYNC (4.6.4). A programmer
 * with sync_after_map (A830Smmu's annibale profile) has every map end with one TLBIASID of the bank and its TLBSYNC too. No fault
 * status, sGFSR or route is polled per operation: a client's page fault never poisons the shared VM (ARCHITECTURE 4.12.3).
 * A table transaction that cannot be proved poisons the VM, keeps every old/new BO reference and FAULTs the owned streams.
 * The real table allocations, context/streams and BO objects remain retained by the owning driver. No implicit destructor
 * cleanup; detach must succeed. Every method serializes on the VM's own lock (ARCHITECTURE 5.4, the M10 lock split); callers
 * may hold their own locks around it but never call back into the VM from a hook. A buffer is unmapped only once the fence of
 * its last use completed (noteUse/setFenceSource) and no job holds it: the GPU is not idled globally. */
