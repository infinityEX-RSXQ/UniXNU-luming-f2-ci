/* The A830 GPU SMMU (ARM MMU-500 at 0x3DA0000, ARCHITECTURE 4.5, 4.12): the read-only survey of S3, the take-over of the GMU
 * bank (CB2, slot 1, SID 5) and the GPU bank (CB0, slot 0, SID 0, LPAC SID 1 on slot 3), the context-fault interrupts, the TLB
 * maintenance the VM's table transactions issue, and release, save and restore.
 *
 * The global register space is emulated by the hypervisor on SM8750 (measured on this phone: S2CR reads 0x03000018 at boot,
 * sCR0 writes are ignored, CB registers hold random values at boot). So only functional bits gate progress: the S2CR type and
 * bank of our routes, our SMRs, SCTLR (written 0 reads 0; enabled reads back what was written, ASIDPNE dropped), the context
 * image under the tolerance rules of 4.5.4 (TCR2.TBI0/TBI1 may read 1, TCR.EPD1 may be cleared once the CP ran), CLIENTPD.
 * ACTLR, sACR, sGFSR and the context FSRs are read, written back where the profile says so, and recorded; they never fail a
 * step.
 *
 * Profiles (A830Profile.h, read once by init()):
 *  - annibale (default): what the REDMI K90 port proved on the same SoC (kernel-sequences 7.4-7.6, section 14 rows 9, 11, 12,
 *    13). Both banks get SCTLR 0x27 (no CFIE, HUPCF or ASIDPNE), TCR 0x00803519 (T0SZ 25, EPD1, no TTBR1 walk fields),
 *    TTBR1 0 and MAIR0 0xF404FF44; ACTLR is written on the GPU bank only; every TLB invalidation is a 32-bit TLBIASID of
 *    the bank's ASID followed by TLBSYNC (also for the VM's transactions, see tableIo); sACR is never written and sGFSR
 *    never written back; 710/712 are not attached (poll() reads the FSRs). The ASID stays CB + 1 (row 11).
 *  - design (0): ARCHITECTURE 4.5.3-4.5.7 as written: SCTLR 0x1167, the kit's TCR (CB0 with the TTBR1 guard fields),
 *    MAIR0 0xFF44, ACTLR on both banks, TLBIALL, sACR.CACHE_LOCK cleared, sGFSR written back, 710/712 attached.
 *
 * Register access: every access goes through the injected ArmSmmu4KIo; on the device A830SmmuBindMmio binds out-of-line
 * helpers that keep every value (zero included) in a general register (never WZR/XZR, which the emulation refuses) and use one
 * 64-bit store for a 64-bit register: TLBIVA/TLBIVAA/TLBIVAL/TLBIVAAL must be single 64-bit stores (the first half of a split
 * store would already invalidate with ASID 0), TLBIASID/TLBIALL/TLBSYNC/SCTLR/FSR are 32-bit registers (ARCHITECTURE 4.5.2). */
