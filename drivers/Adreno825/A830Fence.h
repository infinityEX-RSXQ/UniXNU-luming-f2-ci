/* Ring fences, waits and hang detection (ARCHITECTURE 4.13, PLAN M6/M10/M13).
 *
 * The CP writes the completed seqno to memptrs+4 (CP_EVENT_WRITE7 0x88000031: CACHE_CLEAN | WRITE | IRQ, so the GPU's writes
 * are visible before the seqno, and RBBM_INT_0 bit20 fires). The memptrs page is Normal-NC on both sides: a load-acquire is
 * all a reader needs. Seqnos of the one ring complete in order; a seqno has passed when (int32_t)(fence - seq) >= 0.
 *
 * wait() is the algorithm of 4.13.3: no lock, no MMIO; assert_wait on the fence event with a 16 ms safety slice (against a
 * lost interrupt, never relied on for progress), re-check, thread_block. A thread interrupted before the deadline returns
 * kIOReturnTimeout ("not yet": Turnip retries a timeout and turns every other error into a lost device), kIOReturnNotResponding
 * means the device is lost, kIOReturnAborted only that the caller's connection is closing.
 *
 * The software watchdog (4.13.4): while work is in flight a thread call looks every 500 ms at the fence, the RPTR shadow, and
 * the BR CP_RB_RPTR / CP_IB1_BASE / CP_IB1_REM_SIZE (A830Irq::probe); 2 s without any change is a hang, escalated through
 * A830Irq::escalate (A830IrqFaultWatchdog, reason 18) to the recovery entry.
 *
 * The queue meter (4.13.5): how long each submission waits in the one ring (no priorities: the display's scanout blit queues
 * behind every job submitted before it). The ring stamps every kernel and framed submission right before the barrier and the
 * WPTR write that hand it to the CP (NativeAdrenoRingWaiter::stamp = ringStamp): the time, whose work it is (the kernel's, the
 * render server's or an external process's: NativeAdrenoRingSource*), the ring depth seqno - completed and the seqno go into
 * stamps[seqno % A830FenceQueueStamps]; the depth is also kept as the period's maximum, and a submission that enters a new
 * context (a client switch) is counted. Whoever first sees the completed fence move accounts every seqno between the last
 * accounted one and the new fence, in order (latency = now - stamp): the fence interrupt's top half (signal()), a waiter that
 * finds its fence passed, and, only while no fence interrupt can arrive (polling()), the DCVS thread's takeQueue. One of them
 * accounts at a time (q_busy_); a caller that finds another at work leaves it its call and returns at once, and the accountant
 * passes again until no call came during its pass, so each completion is accounted exactly once and nobody waits: no lock, no
 * MMIO, no allocation, at most A830FenceQueueStamps stamps read per pass.
 * Job attribution (preemption phase 0, ARCHITECTURE 4.17): a job's service time is its completion minus the later of its stamp
 * and the previous job's completion. Several completions seen in one pass give the first one the whole time and the rest none:
 * the render-server service and the latencies are then upper bounds, but fw, n4 and the external busy time can come out low as
 * well as high (an external job behind the first counts none, and so does the fw of a render-server job behind that one). With
 * the fence interrupt a pass spans at most the interrupt's latency; while polling() the passes span up to a poll period and those
 * figures say little (the phase 0 gate reads only periods without polling, 4.17). For each render-server job the external
 * service time ahead of it is the service of the external jobs still in the ring when it was stamped, without the part the
 * oldest of them had already run by then (fw); unknown when a job in between lost its stamp or more than 63 were ahead (the
 * stamp's depth saturates at 127). takeQueue hands the period
 * (submitted, completed, missed, average and longest latency, completions above 16 ms, deepest ring; render-server service and
 * fw average and maximum, fw above 4 ms, external jobs and their service time, context entries) to the status rows once a second
 * and starts the next one. A recovery's forced fence (forceComplete, the orchestrator's CP restart) skips its seqnos (queueSkip)
 * instead of measuring the jobs it failed. */
