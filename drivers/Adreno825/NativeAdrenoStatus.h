 * the faulting address, a global fault (hang class) on every connection, and a recovery counts a suspend on every connection and a

 * what the publish shell tells it; it performs no detection, reset or recovery and never clears a count, so a client cannot hide a
 * fault by re-reading. Interrupt bottom halves count while GetStatus reads, so every access is a relaxed atomic. */
