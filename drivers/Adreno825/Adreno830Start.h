/* The orchestrator: adreno830_start() (declared in Adreno830Board.h) runs the stages S0..S10 of ARCHITECTURE 3.4 in
 * order, records each one in adreno830_status and stops at the first failure: no retry (except the GMU cold boot of S5,
 * at most three attempts with a forced power-off between them, 4.7.3), no rollback of hardware actions (except that a
 * failure after S3 puts the claimed streams back to FAULT, 4.5.7), and nothing is published. Read-back values the
 * hypervisor or the firmware controls (sGFSR, the CB FSRs, CP_RB_RPTR/WPTR at ring start, CP_SQE_CNTL, the GMU AO bits
 * 3/5, GMU2HOST bit 23) are only recorded (section 10); only functional bits are gates.
 *
 * Bring-up profile (A830Profile.h, boot argument pagani-gpu-profile, default 1): S0 checks it and sets
 * adreno830_profile_value before the cmd-db and vote work, so every module reads the same profile from S0 on; row 0 of the
 * overlay ends with p<profile>. The modules switch their own sequences; the orchestrator's part of the annibale profile
 * (REDMI K90 port, kernel-sequences sections 14 and 15) is:
 *  - S1: CX_AHB_{AON,GMU,CP,VBIF_SMMU,HOST}_CNTL = 0x1B12 once HUB runs at 200 MHz, read back exactly (a830CxAhbTimeout),
 *    and again after every CX power-up of a wake (row 6); the design profile writes them only with pagani-gpu-ahbto=1;
 *  - S5: the first GX_BW_PERF_VOTE (HFI M9) at the 160 MHz level, {1, 1, 2} on PKX110 (rows 2, 24); the S5 page adds the
 *    TCM words B4 read back, GENERAL_11 (gmu_general11) and RSC_STATUS0_DRV0 (Adreno830Status.h);
 *  - S6: A830Cp gets its A830CpHealth hooks (9.7 steps 5, 6, 9, 10): sGFSR read through the SMMU window and never written
 *    back, and the GMU side's fault state (A830Gmu::fatalSeen, else one read-only HFI poll of GMU2HOST bit 15 and the NMI
 *    bits); its CP_INIT criterion is bounded by 200 ms (row 33);
 *  - S6-S8 failures and hang verdicts: A830Hfi::drainLate (3 s of late GMU messages, field-notes 9-1) before the streams
 *    FAULT and the status block is written; the counts go to hfi_late ("L<messages>/<acks>/<errors>" on the pages);
 *  - S7, wakes and recoveries: the OOB_GPU of S5 stays set until the next cold boot (row 28, first round; only a P1
 *    slumber entry releases it, A830PowerState);
 *  - S8: GPU interrupt 332 is not attached and not a gate: the CP_MEM_WRITE check passes on the polled fence (16 ms slice)
 *    and the scratch read-back, the DCVS thread retires completed jobs once a second (row 36);
 *  - S10: the DCVS stays at or below 342 MHz unless pagani-gpu-dcvs-max is given (row 38, A830Dcvs).
 * Its two performance switches (Adreno830Board.h, both 0 by default, S0 checks maxlevel <= 16 and irq <= 1):
 *  - pagani-gpu-maxlevel=n: S0 builds the vote tables with A830VotesFullTable (the design's whole DT table, the first vote
 *    still {1, 1, 2}) and S10 hands n to A830Dcvs as the ceiling level (A830DcvsConfig::maxLevel);
 *  - pagani-gpu-irq=1: S8 attaches 332 (step 0x01) with A830IrqConfig::own_mask = the fence interrupt only and runs the
 *    CP_MEM_WRITE check with its interrupt criteria; a refused attach is recorded (irq_off bit 0), a fence interrupt that does
 *    not arrive or wake the waiter turns 332 off for the boot (A830Irq::fallBack); either way S8 carries on with the polled
 *    fences above, never failing for it. With 332 live the fence interrupt wakes waiters and kicks the retirement.
 * S0 hands both to the status block (adreno830_status_knobs): the RUN row ends with " m<n>" and " i1" (" i0" polled).
 * pagani-gpu-hwsched is reserved: anything but 0 stops S0 with reason 24.
 *
 * Bring-up register trace (pagani-gpu-trace, A830Trace.h, ARCHITECTURE 8.7): while adreno830_start runs, a power operation
 * re-runs a stage body or a recovery runs, every access through the tables bound here (rd/wr, the wrapped SMMU, GMU and
 * A830Irq windows, the SMC) is written to BootProgress's ramoops log before it is made, with begin/end lines per stage.
 *
 * Step numbers (ARCHITECTURE 8.3) are what a failure stores in adreno830_status.step, with reg/value/expect as listed. */
