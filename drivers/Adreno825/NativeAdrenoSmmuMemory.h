 * gate; all outputs and the backing pool are disjoint. State starts zeroed.

 * On prepare/publication failure no context has been exposed; caller retains
 * allocation and poisoned state and handles cleanup. No automatic replay.
 * The table walk of the A830 SMMU is coherent (IDR0.CTTW, DT dma-coherent, inner write-back walk attributes): the pages are
 * still cleaned to PoC here and on every change until the S8 self-test V4 proved it (ARCHITECTURE 4.6.1, 4.14.2). */
