/* GPU frequency governor, thermal cap and the run-time service thread of the A830 (ARCHITECTURE 4.16, 5.3.6,
 * IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN M11; M13 d for the ACD ceiling).
 *
 * Busy: the GMU XO power counter 0 (POWER_COUNTER_XOCLK_0_H/L, selected with countable 0x20 and enabled in S5, 4.7.8),
 * 19.2 MHz ticks while the GPU is busy, read high-low-high. A window is two display TEs (16.7 ms at 120 Hz) when the
 * display reports TEs, 16 ms otherwise.
 * Policy (defaults, all in A830DcvsConfig): busy = ticks / (window x 19.2 MHz); demand = current x busy / 0.75.
 *   up: busy >= 0.90 -> at least two levels up and at least the level of demand x 1.25; otherwise demand above the
 *       current frequency -> the lowest level >= demand x 1.1; under thermal pressure (the filtered temperature within
 *       5 C of the target or above it) both rules step up one level per window at most;
 *   sustain: above 734 MHz only a load that kept the GPU at 90 % busy or more: 12 windows in a row (about 200 ms) at the top
 *       level reached so far allow one level more, however far the rules above ask (a burst stops at 734 MHz);
 *   down: one level after 4 consecutive windows (6 right after a step up) whose demand is <= 0.85 x the next lower level (above 734 MHz
 *       <= the next lower level: nothing keeps a load there that does not need it);
 *   idle: 64 ms without a submission and the ring empty -> the floor (pagani-gpu-dcvs-min, 160 MHz);
 *   wake boost: the first submission after idle -> at least 525 MHz for 50 ms;
 *   touch boost: a new touch (PaganiInput's pagani_input_touch_events) -> at least 525 MHz until 300 ms after the last;
 *   under a boost the governor level follows demand up, so the boost does not end in a drop to the floor and the burst of
 *       saturated windows that follows it;
 *   late frame: the display reports a swap after its target TE while the window is more than 50 % busy -> the governor level
 *       + 1 for 100 ms, under the sustain limit;
 * The defaults come from run 20261031-223924-stage1-full-1 (2026-10-31): 70 % / 0.8 held a load at about 55 % busy, so a desktop of
 * 470 MHz of work ran at 832-900 MHz and the GPU's own DDR vote at level 10 (the host vote stays at level 11, A830Dcvs does not lower
 * it: no DDR saving comes from these numbers); one saturated window from 525 MHz or more asked for the top (demand x 1.25 of 1.43 x
 * current); the sustain rule below is what keeps a burst from 832-900 MHz. 75 % and not more because a 120 Hz frame has 8.3 ms: the
 * second's mean fps did not follow the frequency, but the seconds at 115 fps or more did fall with busy (0-60 %: 31/126, 60-75 %: 9/60,
 * 75-85 %: 2/20, 85 % and up: 0/20), and the frames of a model fed that run's load were late by more than one frame twice as often at
 * 85 % as at 75 % (tests: testFrameHeadroom holds the 75 %). A correlation and a model, not a controlled test on the device.
 *   ceiling: pagani-gpu-dcvs-max (734 MHz while ACD is off; with ACD on and no explicit maximum, the table top) and the
 *       thermal ceiling below.
 * Thermal ceiling of the design profile (4.16, 2026-10-30): a closed loop around a target temperature instead of step caps.
 *   input: the hottest GPU sensor of each window (Sm8750Thermal), filtered (1/4 per window); its trend over 500 ms windows:
 *       rising above +0.2 C, falling below -0.2 C, else steady;
 *   down: one level per trend window while the filtered temperature is above the target (pagani-gpu-ttarget, 95 C) and
 *       not falling, never below 525 MHz (the floor that keeps the desktop fluid);
 *   up: one level per 2 s while it stays at least 5 C below the target (the dwell restarts when it leaves that band);
 *   between the two: the ceiling holds (the hysteresis band);
 *   emergency: Sm8750ThermalCritical (105 C, left below 100 C) -> 389 MHz at once and held; once left, back up to the floor
 *       one level per 500 ms;
 *   first reading (at start or after unreadable sensors): at least 5 C below the target -> the top at once, otherwise the
 *       loop works from the ceiling in effect; no usable reading (zone Unknown) -> 607 MHz for as long as that lasts.
 *   The ceiling, the target and the trend show on the DCVS row (" T80+", "!" in an emergency); adreno830_thermal_state()
 *   tells PaganiArmCpu's governor whether this ceiling limits the GPU (the CPU then gives up its top levels, 4.16).
 * Votes: GX_BW_PERF_VOTE {1, level, bus | 0xFFFF0000} only when the level or bus changes; the bus is the level's DT bus,
 * its bus-max while MDP underruns keep growing (5.3.6). A failed vote is counted and the level kept (retried after 1 s).
 * While the GMU sleeps the target is only recorded (A830PowerState::setTarget) and sent as HFI M9 at the next start.
 * pagani-gpu-dcvs=0 votes pagani-gpu-perf once and keeps it (still under the thermal and ACD ceilings).
 *
 * The annibale profile (A830Profile.h, read by init(); kernel-sequences section 13 and section 14 rows 24 and 38) keeps the
 * governor above and changes three things, as the REDMI K90 port runs it on the same SoC:
 *   ceiling: 342 MHz in the first round (no level above it was ever run under XNU); an explicit pagani-gpu-dcvs-max lifts
 *       it (still under the 734 MHz ACD-off ceiling);
 *   thermal: any GPU sensor at 70 C or more, or no usable reading (Sm8750Thermal zone Unknown), holds the GPU at 160 MHz
 *       until every sensor is below 60 C, and the ceiling comes back at once; the design's thermal loop above does not
 *       apply (nor its one-level up rule under pressure);
 *   votes: bw carries the bus level alone (no 0xFFFF0000), and a vote the GMU does not acknowledge ends the frequency
 *       changes for the boot (the GPU stays at the level it last acknowledged, also for the next GMU start).
 * pagani-gpu-maxlevel=n (A830DcvsConfig::maxLevel, both profiles; in the annibale profile S0 then hands over the whole DT
 * table): the knob ceiling is GMU level n (n beyond the table: its top) instead of pagani-gpu-dcvs-max's default and the
 * annibale 342 MHz; an explicit pagani-gpu-dcvs-max still lowers it, the ACD-off 734 MHz and the thermal ceilings still
 * apply. The governor, its boosts and the bus of each level (DT bus, bus-max under underruns) are the ones above.
 *
 * The service thread (run()) also drives the rest of the run-time work: the pending recovery, slumber and touch
 * pre-wake (A830PowerState::tick), the hang watchdog every 500 ms while work is in flight, the fault poll of unwired
 * interrupts and the status rows once a second, and the host DDR floor raise on MDP underruns (4.3.3). */
