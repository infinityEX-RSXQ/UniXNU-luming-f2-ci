/* Host-only (never in the kernel archive, ARCHITECTURE 2.2): the driver reads no device tree at run time; the board's windows, SIDs
 * and interrupts are generated at build time from the DTS and the pinned live.dtb (ARCHITECTURE 3.2). This parser checks those
 * inputs in the host tests (tests/test_board.cpp: the SM8750 / OnePlus 13T GPU, GMU and GPU-SMMU cells).
 * Device-tree memory-window parsing for an Adreno platform node. Cells are
 * big-endian 32-bit as stored in the flattened device tree; the caller passes
 * the raw property bytes and the node's own #address-cells/#size-cells.
 * Only 1 or 2 cells per value are accepted, zero-length windows and any
 * address/size overflow are refused, and the output count is the exact number
 * of complete windows. This parses only; it does not map, claim, power or
 * validate that the addresses belong to a GPU. */
