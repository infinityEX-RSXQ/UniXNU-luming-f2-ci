/* Cold power-up of the SM8750 (A830) GPU clock tree up to the point where the GMU
 * can be loaded: GCC GPU clocks, GPU_CC CX GDSC, GPU_CC_PLL0, the GMU and hub
 * RCGs and the GMU-side branches. GX power is left to the GMU.
 *
 * Register semantics follow Linux drivers/clk/qcom/gpucc-sm8750.c and
 * gcc-sm8750.c, as observed on PKX110 hardware:
 *  - critical CBCRs are only set, never read back (GPU_CC_CXO_AON_CLK reads
 *    0x80000000 after its enable bit is written);
 *  - a branch counts as on when CLK_OFF clears, when its NOC FSM reports ON
 *    (bits 30:28 == 2), or while it is in hardware clock gating (HW_CTL), e.g.
 *    gcc_gpu_gemnoc_gfx_clk reads 0x80000003 (clk_branch2_check_halt);
 *  - PLL and RCG state is read, but no step requires a write to read back
 *    except where Linux waits for the same bit.
 * The caller must already hold the cx.lvl and mx.lvl votes (>= LOW_SVS, the gpucc
 * required-opps) and map both blocks; GX belongs to the GMU. write32 must not
 * return before the store has completed (str + dsb sy on the Device mapping): the
 * sequence relies on it when it moves between GCC and GPU_CC. */
