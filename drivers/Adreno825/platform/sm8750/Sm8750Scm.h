/* Qualcomm secure channel manager (SCM) calls made by XNU at EL1, as Linux
 * drivers/firmware/qcom/qcom_scm-smc.c and qcom_scm.c make them (SMCCC, SMC64, SiP owner):
 *   x0 = function id, x1 = arginfo, x2..x5 = arguments; SMC #0; x0 = status, x1..x3 = results.
 *
 *  - INTERRUPTED (x0 = 1): reissue with x0 = 1, x1..x5 and x7 unchanged and x6 as returned
 *    (ARM_SMCCC_QUIRK_QCOM_A6 carries the session in x6).
 *  - WAITQ_SLEEP (x0 = 2, yielding calls): x1 = wait-queue context, x2 = call context. Wait until the
 *    TZ wait-queue interrupt (SPI 962 / INTID 994, edge) reports that context through the fast call
 *    GET_WQ_CTX, then continue with WAITQ_RESUME(call context). Without the interrupt, GET_WQ_CTX is
 *    polled every millisecond; with it, polling also starts once a wait has gone Sm8750ScmWaitqIrqGraceUs
 *    without our wake (an attached interrupt that is never delivered must not turn every wait into a
 *    timeout).
 *  - EBUSY (x0 = -12): release the lock, sleep 30 ms, reissue the request; at most 20 times.
 *  - Any other non-zero x0 is the request's error; x1 is the result of calls that return one (PAS).
 *    As in Linux, INTERRUPTED/WAITQ_SLEEP/EBUSY are compared as 64-bit values, but the final error code
 *    is the low 32 bits of x0 (qcom_scm_remap_error takes an int) and a PAS result is the low 32 bits
 *    of x1 (the PAS helpers return res.result[0] as an int).
 *
 * Yielding (standard) calls are serialised by the caller's lock and may sleep; interrupts stay enabled.
 * Fast calls take no lock and never sleep (usable from the interrupt handler). Every yielding request is
 * bounded by budget_us (default 1 s) and 10000 SMC instructions. The SMC instruction itself is an
 * injectable function, so the host tests drive every sequence; Sm8750ScmSmcInstruction is the real one. */
