/* The GPU's slices of the SM8750 last-level cache controller (LLCC v6), ARCHITECTURE 4.15 (milestone M11, knob
 * pagani-gpu-llcc, default 0). XNU has no LLCC driver, so nobody has configured or activated the GPU slices:
 *   slice 9  (LLCC_GPU):    max_cap 5632 KiB, priority 1, fixed size, every bonus way, write_scid_en and
 *                           write_scid_cacheable_en; the GPU tags its traffic with it through GBIF_SCACHE_CNTL0/1
 *                           (written by A830Cp, ARCHITECTURE 4.8 step 9a, on every GX power-up);
 *   slice 11 (LLCC_GPUHTW): max_cap 512 KiB, priority 1, fixed size, every bonus way; the SMMU's table walks hit it
 *                           through their outer write-back attribute, no GPU register is involved.
 * Register semantics follow Linux drivers/soc/qcom/llcc-qcom.c (sm8750_cfg: llcc_v6_reg_offset, skip_llcc_cfg = false):
 * _qcom_llcc_cfg_program_v6 for the slice attributes and llcc_update_act_ctrl for (de)activation.
 *
 * Windows (DT cache-controller@24800000, all Device-nGnRE): channel 0 at 0x24800000 (the common status with the bank
 * count is read there), broadcast OR at 0x26800000 (writes reach every bank; a read returns the OR of the banks) and
 * broadcast AND at 0x26C00000 (a read returns the AND of the banks: ACT_COMPLETE on all of them).
 *
 * Policy (ARCHITECTURE 4.15): every register is read before it is written; an attribute that already holds a non-zero
 * (firmware) value is kept as it is; a write that does not read back abandons that slice only, and nothing here ever
 * makes the GPU start fail: a slice that cannot be activated only costs the acceleration. Under Gunyah, an EL1 access
 * the hypervisor refuses is a synchronous external abort, which is why the knob defaults to 0 until M11 qualifies it. */
