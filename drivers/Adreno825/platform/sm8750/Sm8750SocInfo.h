/* SoC identity, GPU speed bin and GPU level table of the SM8750 (A830) for board input stage S0.
 *
 * SMEM (reserved region 0x81D00000, 2 MiB) is read the way Linux drivers/soc/qcom/smem.c reads a
 * partitioned SMEM (version 12): the partition table ("$TOC") in the last 4 KiB, the global partition
 * (host0 == host1 == 0xFFFE, "$PRT") it points at, then item 137 (SMEM_HW_SW_BUILD_ID, struct socinfo):
 * first in the uncached list, then, only if it is not there, in the cached list at the partition's end.
 *
 * On PKX110 only [0x1000, 0x9E000) (the global partition) and [0x1FF000, 0x200000) (the partition
 * table) of the window can be read; any other page takes a synchronous external abort. Every access
 * here is an aligned 32-bit read through one guard that refuses, without issuing it, any read outside
 * both the readable pages and the structure being parsed. The SMEM header page (offset 0) is never read:
 * the partition table alone identifies the partitioned layout. The board maps the window Device-nGnRE
 * (kIOMapInhibitCache), or maps just the two readable ranges and dispatches read32 on the offset: a
 * cacheable or write-combined mapping of the whole window would let the CPU prefetch the faulting pages.
 *
 * The speed bin is the qfprom nvmem cell of the GPU node (0x221C8000 + 0x138, bits [8:0]), read as one
 * aligned 32-bit word (Device mapping).
 * The level table follows KGSL adreno_of_get_pwrlevels for the bin match; by default the driver uses
 * only the levels every bin shares, pagani-gpu-speedbin=1 appends the matched bin's faster levels
 * (docs/ARCHITECTURE.md 4.1.3, 4.1.4). */
