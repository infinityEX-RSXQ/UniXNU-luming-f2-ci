/* Host side of RPMh for the SM8750 (A830) GPU driver, ARCHITECTURE 4.1.1 and 4.3:
 *  - a snapshot of the AOP command DB (DT reserved memory cmd-db@81c60000, 0x20000 bytes),
 *    taken with aligned 32-bit reads, and name lookups of ARC (slave 3), VRM (slave 4) and
 *    BCM (slave 5) entries with their aux data;
 *  - ARC level selection and BCM vote encoding;
 *  - N commands through an idle ACTIVE TCS of the apps RSC DRV-2 (0x16520000), the protocol
 *    of SOC kits/Sm8750Platform/Rpmh.h sm8750_rpmh_vrm_enable() as run on PKX110, generalized
 *    from three VRM commands to 1..16 commands of any slave type;
 *  - the DRV-2 lock shared with the touch rail votes;
 *  - the votes this driver holds itself on apps DRV-2 (mx/cx, CN0, DDR), with HLOS semantics,
 *    never revoked (4.2.3 D5, 4.3.3).
 * Two BCM encoders exist on purpose and must not be mixed (4.3.2): the GMU bandwidth table
 * (HFI M2, voted by the GMU through the GPU RSC; Linux a8xx: valid 0 at 0 kBps, ACV BIT(2)) and
 * the host votes (Linux HLOS interconnect: SH0/MC0/CN0 keepalive, never valid 0; ACV BIT(0)).
 * Formats follow Linux drivers/soc/qcom/cmd-db.c, rpmh-rsc.c, include/soc/qcom/tcs.h,
 * interconnect/qcom/bcm-voter.c, sm8750.c and KGSL adreno_rpmh.c. No allocation and no logging;
 * hardware is reached only through the callbacks. Only the ACTIVE set is ever written;
 * sleep/wake TCSes are never touched. */
