"""Stage the public IOStorageFamily headers the storage transports compile against.

The storage transports (DadaUfs, VirtioMmioBlock, RamBlock) include
<IOKit/storage/IOBlockStorageDevice.h>. That header is not part of the xnu source tree: the storage classes
live in Apple's separate IOStorageFamily project, and the target kernelcache carries the original kext. The
headers here are the public Darwin 23 originals, staged where the archive builders already look
(build/storage-abi/include), so a transport is compiled against the class layout the prelinked original
kext exports rather than against a locally reinvented one.

This is deliberately not part of scripts/audit-storage-interface.py. That script is a qualification
instrument: it also compiles a reference object, reads the vtable of the prelinked original kext and checks
the dispatch shape, which needs build/native-prelink/native-apfs-load-positive.macho -- an artifact of the
prelink step that does not exist while the archives are built. It uses stage() so both share one pinned
IOStorageFamily revision.
