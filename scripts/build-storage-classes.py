"""Compile the IOStorageFamily base class the storage transports inherit from.

The storage transports (drivers/DadaUfs, drivers/VirtioMmioBlock) are subclasses of
IOBlockStorageDevice. That class is not part of the xnu source tree: it lives in Apple's separate
IOStorageFamily project, and the public headers are staged into build/storage-abi/include so the
transports can compile against them. A header alone is not enough at link time, though -- a subclass
needs the metaclass, the constructor and the vtable of its base, and a kernel is a statically linked
Mach-O with no dynamic lookup:

    Undefined symbols for architecture arm64:
      "IOBlockStorageDevice::gMetaClass", referenced from:
          NativeUfsBlock::MetaClass::MetaClass() in libDadaUfs.a(DadaUfs.o)
      "vtable for IOBlockStorageDevice", referenced from:
          NativeUfsBlock::start(IOService*) in libDadaUfs.a(DadaUfs.o)

So the base class itself is compiled from the same pinned IOStorageFamily revision the headers come
from, and linked into the kernel by board.toml [kernel] archives.

Only IOBlockStorageDevice.cpp is built. It is the class the transports derive from; the rest of
IOStorageFamily (IOMedia, the partition schemes, IOBlockStorageDriver) is a kext that the kernelcache
carries and this port does not replace. The file itself is self-contained: its only includes are
IOLib, IOUserClient and its own header, and its only external references are IOService/IOUserClient
(XNU) plus the IOStorage*Options enums, which are typedefs.

The reference object of scripts/audit-storage-interface.py is the same translation unit compiled for
the ABI audit; this builder makes an archive the linker can use.
