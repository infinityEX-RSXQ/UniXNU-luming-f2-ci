"""Bind a storage transport's IOBlockStorageDevice imports to the kernelcache kext.

A block transport derives from IOBlockStorageDevice, which is not part of the xnu tree: it is a class
of Apple's separate IOStorageFamily project, and the target kernelcache already carries
com.apple.iokit.IOStorageFamily. There are only two ways to give the transport a base class:

  - compile IOBlockStorageDevice.cpp and link it, which registers a second class of that name and
    makes OSMetaClass panic ("class IOBlockStorageDevice is a duplicate; kext __kernel__ already has
    a class by that name", libkern/c++/OSMetaClass.cpp);
  - resolve the transport's imports to the addresses the prelinked kext has at run time.

scripts/build-native-virtio-bindings.py takes the second road for the virtio transports, but it
reads build/storage-abi/interface-audit.json, which scripts/audit-storage-interface.py produces from
build/darwinboot-storage-native-metadata/gdb-stop.json and a prelink candidate
(build/native-prelink/native-apfs-load-positive.macho). Neither input has a builder in this tree:
they are made by hand in a maintainer's HVF session, and the audit JSON is not committed. That is
why the virtio path cannot be reproduced in CI.

This script takes the same road without the live observation. The audit's method list and original
targets are recoverable from images the build already has:

  - the base class dispatch shape is the reference object of build-storage-classes.py, which
    compiles the same pinned IOBlockStorageDevice.cpp the transport compiles its header from;
  - the original vtable is the one run of 190 pointers in the kext's __DATA_CONST whose entries are
    either an original kernel export or an address inside the kext's own __TEXT_EXEC. That
    signature is what makes the identification unique: the audit records 176 kernel bindings and
    14 pure virtual slots, and the inherited-dispatch tables nearby have 33+ kext-internal
    entries, so they cannot be confused with it;
  - the metaclass, the protected constructor and the base destructor are decoded from that
    vtable's anchors with the same AArch64 instruction patterns the audit uses.

The bundle's symbol table is empty in the kernelcache (the nlist is stripped), so names cannot be
used for the original class. They are not needed: the vtable carries every target the transport can
import, and the reference vtable gives the slot each target belongs to, which is what turns an
import name into an address.
