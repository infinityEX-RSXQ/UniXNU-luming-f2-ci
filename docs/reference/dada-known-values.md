# Known values and open measurements

Every number `board.toml`, `dts/dada.dts` and the typed `[adt]` tables pin, where it comes from, and
what still has to be read on the phone. Values are from the **stock** device tree
(`uefi-dada/Resources/DTBs/dada.dtb`), the Mu-Silicium platform package, or the mainline bring-up
tree (`dada_kernel/device-tree/sm8750-xiaomi-dada-mainline.dts`); the two trees agree on every
address below.

## Memory map

| Region | Address | Size | Source |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| UEFI FD | `0xA7100000` | `0x300000` | `Resources/Configs/dada.toml`, `MemoryMapLib.c` `UEFI_FD` |
| FD reserved (before) | `0xA7000000` | `0x100000` | `MemoryMapLib.c` `FD_Reserved` |
| FD reserved (after) | `0xA7400000` | `0x200000` | `MemoryMapLib.c` `UEFI_FD_Reserved` |
| UEFI stack | `0xA760D000` | `0x40000` | `dada.dsc` `PcdCPUCoresStackBase`, `MemoryMapLib.c` |
| Kernel reservation | `0xA8000000` | `0x10000000` | `MemoryMapLib.c` `Kernel` |
| UFS PHY / controller / ICE / MCQ | `0x01D80000` | `0x28000` | stock DT nodes, `edk2-msm/ufs-info-dada.txt` |
| APSS block (GIC, timer, UFS) | `0x16000000` | `0x06000000` | `MemoryMapLib.c` `APSS_HM` |

`unixnu build firmware` checks the FD and stack numbers against the checkout before building; a
mismatch is an error, not a warning.

## Interrupts and timers

| Item | Value | Source |
| --- | --- | --- |
| GIC distributor | `0x16000000` + `0x10000` | `interrupt-controller@16000000` |
| GIC redistributor | `0x16080000` + `0x200000`, stride `0x40000` | same node (`#redistributor-regions = 1`) |
| GIC ITS | `0x16040000` + `0x20000` | `msi-controller@0x16040000` |
| Timer | `0x16800000`, `clock-frequency = 0x124f800` (19.2 MHz) | `timer@16800000` |
| Timer PPIs | 29/30/27/26 | ACPI stage 1 notes (`dada-uefi.md`) |

## CPUs

Stock tree `/cpus` reg values, in order:

| CPU node | `reg` | Cluster |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `cpu@0` … `cpu@500` | `0x000` … `0x500` | 6 efficiency/performance cores |
| `cpu@10000` | `0x10000` | prime core (Aff2 = 1) |
| `cpu@10100` | `0x10100` | prime core (Aff2 = 1) |

The SoC DTSI reproduces them exactly and `dts/dada.dts` adds the timer rate. The generator accepts
values above `0xffff` because of the two prime cores, and requires `Aff0 == 0`.

## ADT

| Key | Value | Note |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `dram-base` | `0x80000000` | DDR starts here on SM8750 |
| `dram-size` | `0x80000000` (2 GiB) | Measured 15.12 GiB total but fragmented across 16 regions (`0xa00000000` 8 GiB, `0x8c0000000` 5 GiB, rest scattered below `0xd8000000`); the ADT holds one contiguous pair, so 2 GiB is the conservative first-boot value. See *Memory map* below |
| `owned-memory-size` | `0x10000000` (256 MiB) | The window DarwinBoot hands to XNU, as ONE conventional-memory run. 256 MiB is the size that was measured to allocate on this phone (the run the loader picked was at physical `0xbc007c000`); 1 GiB was never observed to be allocatable. **TODO(device)**: enlarge for the Data ramdisk stage |
| `chip_id` | `0x208` | software identity seed for `IOPlatformUUID`, not an Apple chip id |
| CPUs | `/cpus` reg values | `dts/dada.dts` includes the SoC DTSI; the generator emits one `cpuN` per enabled CPU |
| `psci_method` | `smc` | SoC DTSI `/psci` node, `method = "smc"` |
| `crypto-hash-method` | `sha2-384` | OS profile `[adt.chosen]` |
| `root_match_volume_uuid` | `04769D26-2CA0-4825-B443-E2E5F88300F2` | APSB superblock of `044-76040-038.dmg`; `[payload.adt]` |

## DRAM

Parsed from the stock tree's `memory` node (`#address-cells = 2`, `#size-cells = 2`), 16 non-empty
regions, **15.12 GiB** total:

| Address | Size | Note |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `0xa00000000` | 8 GiB | largest single region |
| `0x8c0000000` | 5 GiB | |
| `0x880000000` | 0.74 GiB | |
| below `0xd8000000` | ~1.3 GiB | 13 scattered fragments; gunyah owns `0x80000000..0x81200000` |

`dram-base = 0x80000000` with `dram-size = 0x80000000` describes only the low 2 GiB, which the ADT
cannot subdivide anyway. This is a **first-boot** value, not a statement that XNU owns all 15.12 GiB.

## Panel handover

| Item | Value | Source |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `splash_region` | present in `Resources/DTBs/dada.dtb` | `/reserved-memory/splash_region` |
| `label` | `cont_splash_region` | same node |
| `reg` | `0xfc800000` + `0x2b00000` | same node |
| GOP framebuffer | `1200x2670`, stride `0x12c0` (4800), `a8r8g8b8`, base `0xfc800000`, size `0xC38E80` | `dada_kernel/docs/uefi-fix.md` (measured through the UEFI GOP) |

The node name must stay exactly `splash_region`, with no unit address: Qualcomm's ABL looks it up by
that literal path and tears the display down if it is missing. dada's stock tree already has it, so
**no `[[bootimg.dtb_node]]` override is needed** -- and adding one would break the build, because
`fdtput -c` on an existing node fails with `FDT_ERR_EXISTS` and `unixnu bootimg` treats that as an
error.

## Userdata partition

| Item | Value | Source |
| --- | --- | --- |
| partition | `linux` | GPT entry of LUN 0 |
| `first_lba` | `101074176` (`0x06064500`) | `/sys/class/block/sda36`: start 808593408 x 512 / 4096 |
| `last_lba` | `125488383` (`0x077ACCFF`) | same entry, 195313664 x 512 / 4096 bytes |
| `lba_bytes` | `4096` | logical block size |
| capacity | `100000595968` B (93.1 GiB) | last - first + 1 blocks |

The partition carries the SHNGROOT manifest and the IPSW's OS and SystemOS windows, so it is separate
from the `userdata` partition sheng uses. `board.toml [userdata]` holds these values.

## Firmware inputs

| Item | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Mu-Silicium config | `Resources/Configs/dada.toml` |
| DSC / FDF | `Platforms/Xiaomi/dadaPkg/dada.dsc`, `dada.fdf` |
| Firmware volume | `Build/dadaPkg/{DEBUG,RELEASE}_CLANGPDB/FV/SILICIUM_UEFI.fd` |
| Defines | `ENABLE_SECUREBOOT=0`, `MEMORY_PROTECTION=TRUE`, `SHIP_MODE=FALSE`, `BUILDID_STRING=dada-research` |
| Mu_Basecore patches | `AsmMacroLib`, `Auth-Service`, `Boot-Manager`, `Timer`, `Usb-Bus` (same series as `build_uefi.py`) |
| Submodules | `Binaries` (= `Device-Binaries`, branch `dada`), `Common/Mu`, `Common/Mu_OEM_Sample`, OpenSSL |
| Boot image | Android header v4, `requires_kernel_header = true`, gzip, DTB appended |

`Silicium-ACPI` is not in the submodule list: dada ships its own ACPI tables in
`Platforms/Xiaomi/dadaPkg/AcpiTables`, and the DSC does not include the Silicium-ACPI tree.

## Boot image

| Item | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Android header | v4 (`Resources/Configs/dada.toml`), no load addresses, 4 KiB page |
| BootShim | `requires_kernel_header = true`, so the ARM64 header is present |
| Firmware volume | exactly `0x300000` bytes at `0xA7100000` |
| Device tree | appended after the gzip stream (`Resources/DTBs/dada.dtb`) |
| Shim header `image_size` | the shim plus the firmware volume, not `FD_SIZE` alone |

Two stock trees need a change before `unixnu bootimg` accepts the image; the patches are in
`docs/patches/`.

| Patch | Tree | Why |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `unixnu-bootimg-header-v4.patch` | UniXNU | `verify()` only understood header v0-v2; v4 has no addresses, a fixed 4 KiB page and a 4 KiB signature block |
| `mu-silicium-bootshim-header-size.patch` | Mu-Silicium | `BootShim.S` writes `FD_SIZE` into the ARM64 `image_size`; UniXNU verifies shim + firmware volume |
| `mu-silicium-unixnu-components.patch` | Mu-Silicium | puts `UniXNU.inf`, `UniXNUDxe.inf` and `DarwinBoot.inf` into `dada.dsc`/`dada.fdf`; without it the volume holds only Mu-Silicium and the menu you see is Mu-Silicium's |

Checked locally against the RELEASE firmware volume, with an empty ramdisk:

```
ANDROID! v4, kernel 2,185,293 B, ramdisk 0 B, image 2,195,456 B
gzip inflates to 3,145,840 B = 112 B shim + 0x300000 firmware volume, then 966,281 B of DTB
```

## ESP (sda35)

The phone's ESP is `/dev/block/sda35` (`/dev/block/by-name/esp`), 1,199,570,944 bytes (1.117 GiB).
dada uses it as the payload volume for firmware boots that carry no initrd. It is FAT32 with
**4096-byte logical sectors** (the UFS LUN 0 block size), 4-sector clusters, label `DADAESP` and
serial `5348-4E47`.

| Item | Value |
| --- | --- |
| device | `/dev/block/sda35`, `by-name/esp` |
| bytes | `1,199,570,944` (`292,864` x 4096) |
| filesystem | FAT32, 4096-byte logical sectors, 4-sector clusters |
| contents | `EFI/UniXNU/unixnu.toml`, `EFI/UniXNU/build-info.txt`, `EFI/UniXNU/Payloads/kernel.macho`, `EFI/UniXNU/Payloads/kernel.macho.adt` |
| kernel.macho | 51,044,352 bytes, sha256 `39e8fb3ceac8ef7cc15cc287d5134f075c0e57379957047be1592f3fda6157e5` |
| kernel.macho.adt | 13,852 bytes, sha256 `165c5a17ea2c2f30f254df0d80237dab20a703e9f09121094e69e6d0ee279155` (regenerated per build: it carries a fresh random seed) |

An image written by `unixnu build payload` uses 512-byte logical sectors. Copied to this 4K-logical
partition, Linux refuses it with `FAT-fs (sda35): logical sector size too small for device`. Build the
ESP image with the same file tree and a 4096-byte filesystem sector (`mformat -F -T 292864 -M 4096`),
then write it with `dd`; verify the readback hash and mount it read-only before rebooting.

## Host build, 2026-10-26

Linux host (Ubuntu 24.04, 12 jobs, `/opt/unixnu-linux` toolchain, cached 21H461 kernelcache):

| Step | Result |
| --- | --- |
| kernel + prelink | `kernel.macho`, 51,044,352 bytes, sha256 `d47f4ac9760857ef49fa03efc47de58e157854dca23f95174d6bf56c6ecae57b` |
| prelink selection | 24 components; no `AppleMobileFileIntegrity` and no `ApplePMGR`; no early security initializer; slide `-0x1000000` |
| firmware | `SILICIUM_UEFI.fd`, `0x300000` bytes, sha256 `e53a559c9a9a4293a5ab72b86a4d08b3cd231e88863d5bcc198445c5a505ff28`; contains UniXNU, UniXNUDxe, UniXNURamDiskDxe and DarwinBoot |
| payload | `payload.img`, 192 MiB `DADAESP`, ADT 13,852 bytes |
| boot image | `boot.img`, 203,558,912 bytes, Android header v4, sha256 `f6d3b119c831aff32d272a2dc16edb293161286a17c75bbabb2ef5d20e1957f3` |

`docs/patches` carries the changes that are not upstream yet:
`unixnu-bootimg-header-v4.patch` (header v4 verification),
`unixnu-payload-amfi-guard.patch` (require PMGR only when AMFI is prelinked) and
`unixnu-ufs-archive-override.patch` (honour `XNU_NATIVE_UFS_ARCHIVE`) and
`unixnu-owner-cache-bringup.patch` (SystemOS mount without owner trust) for
UniXNU, and `mu-silicium-unixnu-ramdisk.patch` for the `UniXNURamDiskDxe`
entry in the firmware DSC/FDF. UniXNU's `components.toml` also carries the
`DadaUfs` entry. The platform seed was a placeholder; the image was not
flashed.

## Chip identity

The IPSW identity (`iPad7,1` / iPadOS 17.7.11 / `21H461` / `j120ap`) is the image the UniXNU kernel
build and prelink are pinned to; it says nothing about the phone. The OS profile's typed `[adt]` tables
make the ADT present the same identity so `libMobileGestalt` matches, which is what the later userland
stages need. The board overrides `/product/model` with `xiaomi,dada` and clears
`amfi-only-platform-code` because no AMFI is prelinked. Switch the identity off in a private profile
for a neutral first-boot tree, or replace it with a phone identity when one is chosen.

## Kernel build: what is selected, and why

`configs/dada_defconfig` starts from the sheng reference and keeps only what the first boot needs. The
archive builders in `board.toml [kernel] archives` are exactly the ones those switches require;
`scripts/build-xnu-4k-baseline.sh` links each with `-Wl,-force_load` and fails on a missing archive.

| Switch | Value | Builder in `[kernel] archives` |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `XNU_SOURCE_CORECRYPTO14` | `y` | `build-corecrypto-14.py` + `--namespace` |
| `XNU_SOURCE_PTHREAD` | `y` | `build-libpthread-kernel.py` |
| `XNU_ARM_DT_PLATFORM` | `y` | `build-arm-driver.py ArmDTPlatform` |
| `XNU_ARMCPU` | `y` | `build-arm-driver.py ArmCpu` |
| `XNU_NATIVE_UFS` | `y` | `component:DadaUfs` + the storage class/binding builders |
| `XNU_NATIVE_AES` | `y` | `component:SoftwareAES` + `build-software-aes-bindings.py` |
| `XNU_BOOT_PROGRESS` | `n` | none |
| `XNU_NATIVE_LEGACY_DISPLAY` | `n` | none |

### Storage transport mode

`CONFIG_XNU_NATIVE_UFS` is `y`. Two facts decided how it is built:

1. `DadaUfs` is the board fork of the sheng (SM8550) transport. `drivers/DadaUfs` keeps only the
   qcom,ufshc/qcom,sm8750-ufshc names, the SM8750 GCC offsets and the `linux` root partition (see
   *UFS* below and `docs/ufs-dada.md`), so it attaches to this controller.
2. It cannot be linked with its own base class. A transport derives from `IOBlockStorageDevice`, a
   class that is not in the xnu tree. Compiling that class into the kernel collides with the
   kernelcache's own `com.apple.iokit.IOStorageFamily` kext:

   ```
   OSMetaClass: Kext com.apple.iokit.IOStorageFamily class IOBlockStorageDevice is a duplicate;
    kext __kernel__ already has a class by that name. cpp:896
   ```

   That was the second panic this port reached (the first was the panic-log address, below). The board
   therefore builds the class only as a reference object and rebinds the transport's imports to the
   prelinked kext's own addresses; `scripts/build-storage-classes.py` and
   `scripts/build-storage-kext-bindings.py` implement that step, and the kernel links
   `build/dada-ufs/libDadaUfs.a` through the board's `CONFIG_XNU_NATIVE_UFS_ARCHIVE` override. The
   prelinked kext registers the class exactly once.

### Why AMFI is not prelinked

`com.apple.driver.AppleMobileFileIntegrity` (AMFI) and `com.apple.driver.ApplePMGR` are not in
`[kernel.prelink] roots`, and `[kernel.prelink] early_security_init` is not set.

AMFI asks the policy manager (PMGR) for every policy decision and panics with

```
"AMFI: No PMGR?y\n" @ConfigurationSettings.cpp:235
```

when no PMGR has published its nub. Nothing on this board publishes one: the PMGR path is the
owner-root path (on the sheng reference port `build-sheng-platform-power.py` instantiates Apple's own
`ApplePMGR` class to publish the nub), and owner-root is out of scope for this port. The owner-root
path also needs storage -- it authenticates the root volume -- so it cannot come before the storage
driver anyway.

Dropping AMFI from the roots is not enough on its own: the prelink plan selects the roots *and their
`OSBundleLibraries` dependency closure*, and four of the roots declare AMFI as a dependency:

| Root | Declares |
| --- | --- |
| `com.apple.iokit.IOGPUFamily` | `com.apple.driver.AppleMobileFileIntegrity` |
| `com.apple.iokit.IOMobileGraphicsFamily` | `com.apple.driver.AppleMobileFileIntegrity` |
| `com.apple.iokit.IOHIDFamily` | `com.apple.driver.AppleMobileFileIntegrity` |
| `com.apple.security.sandbox` | `com.apple.driver.AppleMobileFileIntegrity` |

So those four are out as well (they are the GPU, the display accelerator, the input stack and the
sandbox -- none of them is needed for the video console, which is XNU's own pexpert console drawn
straight into the framebuffer), together with the codeless `com.apple.iokit.IOHIDEventDriver` that
only exists for IOHIDFamily. `com.apple.driver.ApplePMGR` was only ever in the closure as a
dependency of AMFI, so it goes too. The closure of the remaining 24 roots holds no AMFI.

The early security initializer only ran the AMFI initializer, so it goes with AMFI; the kernel calls
an early initializer only when the prelink metadata names one. The ADT loses
`amfi-only-platform-code` as well: only AMFI reads it.

### Why the trust cache runtime is off

Without AMFI the boot stops one step earlier, in the kernel itself:

```
amfi interface not available @kern_trustcache.c:477
```

`trust_cache_runtime_init()` (`bsd/kern/kern_trustcache.c`) demands both the Image4 and the AMFI
interface and panics without them. The port patch `native-trust-cache-runtime.patch` compiles that
call into the boot only when `XNU_NATIVE_TRUST_CACHE` is 1:

```c
-#ifndef BCM2837
+#if !defined(BCM2837) || (defined(XNU_NATIVE_TRUST_CACHE) && XNU_NATIVE_TRUST_CACHE)
```

so `CONFIG_XNU_TRUST_CACHE_RUNTIME=n` keeps the whole block (the runtime init *and* the static trust
cache load) out of the kernel. Nothing else on this board needs it: the ADT carries an empty
`TrustCache` node, and the remaining users of the `amfi` interface are the code-signing and shared
region paths, which only run for user processes.

So the two AMFI panics are both gone: the `"AMFI: No PMGR"` one needs the kext, and the
`"amfi interface not available"` one needs the runtime.

Without AMFI the boot continues past the kext starts into the root mount, where the missing storage
driver is what stops it.

### Why the panic log region comes from the device tree

`CONFIG_XNU_DT_PANIC_REGION=y`. With it off, pexpert's `check_for_panic_log()` falls back to
`PLATFORM_PANIC_LOG_PADDR` (`0x3c0fc000`), the QEMU/Raspberry Pi address of the BCM2837 platform
file. On this board that address is a hole in DRAM, so the kernel mapped it and then cleared 16 KiB
there before the console existed: the write aborted and the boot hung with no output at all. With the
switch on, the region is looked up in the device tree; the board has no panic region yet, so the
lookup fails and the whole path is skipped -- what the sheng reference port does too.

### Why boot progress is off

`build-xnu-4k-baseline.sh` refuses `XNU_BOOT_PROGRESS=1` unless the audited UFS/owner-root, Virtio block
and source-corecrypto build are selected together, because the boot page reports stages of the owner-root
path. dada has no owner-root path yet. With `XNU_BOOT_PROGRESS=0` every `boot_progress_*` call compiles to
a no-op macro (`patches/xnu/zzz-boot-progress.patch`), so the patch stays applied and costs nothing. The
`boot-progress=2` entry in `kernel_args` is a runtime argument of the XNU side and is unrelated to this
build switch.

### Why the legacy display instrument is off

`build-native-legacy-display.py` compiled `kits/sheng` sources — touch, keystore, GPU power, Novatek,
cpufreq — to drive the original `IOMobileFramebufferLegacy` lifecycle. Those are SM8550 board programs.

The text console does not need it. DarwinBoot fills `boot_args.Video[6]` from the UEFI GOP
(`drivers/DarwinBoot/DarwinBootPkg/Driver/BootVideo.h`: base, display=1, rowBytes, width, height,
depth=32) and XNU's own `pexpert` video console draws through that. The instrument becomes necessary
when a framebuffer *service* is wanted rather than a console, and it needs a trimmed, board-neutral
builder first.

### DadaUfs verified block mode

`drivers/DadaUfs` serves reads through `configureVerification()` only when `NATIVE_VERIFIED_BLOCK` is
defined. That path requires an owner-signed policy bundle at run time: with no policy it refuses with
`policy count invalid` and never publishes the device, so no root is reachable. This repository's
`scripts/build-arm-driver.py` therefore does not force the macro; it follows `--verified-root`, matching
`sheng`'s `CONFIG_XNU_VERIFIED_ROOT_PROBE=y` + bundle. dada has no bundle yet, so the driver compiles
without it and `start()` returns `true` directly.

## Boot progress on the phone

Measured, in order, on the real device (each step is the panic the screen showed):

| Step | What the screen showed | Cause |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | black screen, no output, no probe answered | `check_for_panic_log()` mapped the BCM2837 panic-log address in a DRAM hole and wrote to it before the console existed |
| 2 | kernel console output, then a panic screen with a message, `TCR=`, `SCTRL=`, `pages=`, `free=` | the panic screen renderer works: the message and the register sample are drawn on the framebuffer |
| 3 | `OSMetaClass: ... IOBlockStorageDevice is a duplicate` | the port built `IOBlockStorageDevice` into the kernel, colliding with the kernelcache's own IOStorageFamily kext |
| 4 | `"AMFI: No PMGR?y\n" @ConfigurationSettings.cpp:235` | AMFI wanted the PMGR nub that only the owner-root path publishes |
| 5 | `amfi interface not available @kern_trustcache.c:477` | the kernel's own trust cache runtime demands the AMFI interface, and AMFI was no longer prelinked |
| 6 | `Failed to mount root device @IOKitBSDInit.cpp:304` | the boot reached the root mount with no root media, because no userdata image was flashed |
| 7 | `Kernel data abort` at `pc 0xfffffff00797ce24` (`IOTaskHasEntitlement+0x44`), `lr 0xfffffff00797ce18`, `esr 0x96000006` (data abort, translation fault level 2, read), `far 0x1b0` | the root image on the linux partition mounted and `launchd` was exec'd. AMFI is not prelinked, so `amfi` is NULL and the entitlement query dereferenced `amfi + 0x1b0`. The call chain is `bsdinit_task` -> `___mac_execve` -> `process_signature` -> `machine_task_process_signature` -> `IOTaskHasEntitlement` |
| 8 | `Kernel data abort` at `pc 0xfffffff00794a0d0` (`IOUserClient::copyClientEntitlement+0x58`), `esr 0x96000005`, `far 0x1d0` | the same NULL `amfi`, reached from an `fsctl`/`VNOP_IOCTL` path into `IOUserClient::copyClientEntitlement`; the more-guards patch returns no entitlement there too |

Step 1 is fixed by the device-tree panic region; step 3 by not linking the base class and binding the
transport imports to the kext instead; steps 4 and 5 by leaving AMFI and the PMGR out of the prelinked
kernel and by compiling the trust cache runtime out.

Step 6 was the milestone without a root image. The image now lives on the linux partition
(`/dev/block/sda36`), DadaUfs publishes its window, and the root volume mounts; the first userland exec
reaches step 7.

Step 7 and step 8 are the same AMFI wall from different callers: exec asks AMFI for entitlements,
and an ioctl path asks `IOUserClient` for them. This kernel prelinks no AMFI, so `amfi` is NULL.
`patches/xnu/zzzzz-dada-entitlements-without-amfi.patch` and
`patches/xnu/zzzzzz-dada-more-amfi-null-guards.patch` return "not entitled" (or no data) at every
reachable site instead of dereferencing NULL. That is a bring-up guard, not a security policy; the
proper fix is the owner-root path with AMFI and PMGR prelinked.

### AMFI + PMGR attempt

Restoring AMFI is the real fix, and sheng runs this same kernelcache with an ABI-qualified `ApplePMGR`
subclass (`ShengPlatformPower`) that publishes the nub AMFI asks for. That instrument is not
reproducible from this workspace:

- `scripts/build-sheng-platform-power.py` requires reference prelink candidates under
  `build/xnu-prelink/` (`native-owner-ufs-*-candidate.macho`). They are build products of sheng's
  owner-root experiments and are not in the repository.
- The build binds `sheng_original_pmgr_nub_create/read/write` and the ApplePMGR vtable entries to
  absolute addresses inside that candidate; without it the bindings cannot be derived.

So AMFI + PMGR stays unbuilt here. The no-AMFI guards above are what keeps the boot moving until those
owner-root candidates (or a PMGR provider for this board) are available.

The `?y` in the step 4 message is literal text of the kext's message, not a rendering fault: the panic
screen skips characters below 32 and prints the rest as they are.

### Exec policy bring-up bypass

With the lock initialised, `launchd` was killed by an exec policy failure:
`unexpected SIGKILL of launchd` with `namespace 9 code 0x8`, i.e. `OS_REASON_EXEC` /
`EXEC_EXIT_REASON_SECURITY_POLICY`, and no description, which is the `imgp->ip_mac_return` path:
AMFI's signature hook rejected the init binary because no StaticTrustCache is packaged.

`patches/xnu/zzzzzzzzzzzzzzz-dada-no-cs-bringup.patch` clears `ip_mac_return` and the `ip_cs_error`
reason when the boot argument `dada-no-cs=1` is present (it is in the payload arguments). This is a
bring-up bypass, not policy: it only affects the exec gate and the board must be given a real
`StaticTrustCache.img4` (IPSW component, not in the local cache) for a faithful boot.

### Static trust cache

The exec policy denial is answered with the two original version-2 trust-cache modules from the IPSW
(no `StaticTrustCache.img4` exists in this restore; the per-dmg `Firmware/*.dmg.trustcache` entries
carry them). `inputs/trustcache/provenance.json` records the download and hashes:

| Input | Module SHA-256 | Entries |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `044-76040-038.dmg.trustcache` | `da88460e…0fc2` | 2478 |
| `044-76034-038.dmg.trustcache` | `d121ba89…3651` | 76 |

Bundled as `u32 count=2, offsets[12, 12+59496], module, module` the result is
`7416ca4f8377146626bb284e2133c76bee6cb4e3ee0af5d648b186235a7323a7`, the first
`profiles/os/ipados-17.7.11-21H461` `payload.trust_cache_sha256` pin. `unixnu payload --trust-cache`
copies it to `Payloads/kernel.macho.trustcache`, and DarwinBoot validates it (`ValidTrustCaches`:
version 2 modules, 24-byte sorted entries) before publishing the ADT node.

The IPSW was fetched with HTTP range requests because DNS for `updates.cdn-apple.com` is hijacked to
`198.18.0.136` in this environment; the Apple CNAME was resolved over DoH and the requests pinned to
`200.25.91.48`. Only the zip central directory tail and the two small trust-cache entries were
downloaded (about 1 MiB plus 56 KiB).

### Trust cache lock (bring-up)

With AMFI finally prelinked, the first `launchd` exec went through
`mac_vnode_check_signature` -> `ubc_cs_blob_add` -> `query_trust_cache` and panicked with
`Taking non-sleepable RW lock with preemption enabled @ lock_rw.c:14`.

`lck_rw_init()` marks a lock sleepable (`lck_rw_can_sleep = true`); the zero-initialised lock does not.
`CONFIG_XNU_TRUST_CACHE_RUNTIME=n` compiled `trust_cache_runtime_init()` out, so
`trust_cache_rt_lock` stayed zero-initialised while the AMFI path still queried it. The setting is now
`y`, and `[kernel.prelink] early_security_init` is restored to the profile value
`com.apple.driver.AppleMobileFileIntegrity=0xfffffff005ab4ae0`; that initializer runs during the kernel
bootstrap, before `trust_cache_runtime_init()` in `osfmk/kern/startup.c`, so `amfi` exists when the
runtime initialises its lock. AMFI and PMGR are also listed explicitly in the roots.

No StaticTrustCache or Cryptex SystemTrustCache is packaged yet (the local IPSW cache has only the
kernelcache), so the next boot decides whether the trust cache query finds the init binary or kills it.

### PMGR instrument (dada)

`sandbox_get_container_expected()` failed because `launchd` asks the sandbox kext for its container and
the prelinked sandbox kext needs AMFI and PMGR. Adding `com.apple.security.sandbox` to the prelink roots
pulled `com.apple.driver.AppleMobileFileIntegrity` and `com.apple.driver.ApplePMGR` in as dependencies
(27 components), but AMFI still needs an `ApplePMGRNub` service.

sheng's instrument is reused as a dada component: `drivers/DadaPlatformPower/ShengPlatformPower.cpp`
plus `scripts/build-dada-platform-power.py` build the `ApplePMGR` subclass and publish the nub, called
from `bsd_init()` under `CONFIG_XNU_SHENG_PMGR=y` with boot argument `sheng-pmgr=2`.

sheng derived its bindings from an owner-root prelink candidate that this workspace does not carry. The
same kernelcache and the same `-0x1000000` slide place the same functions at the same virtual
addresses, so the builder binds them directly and the addresses were checked in this tree:

| Symbol | Address | Check |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `__ZN9ApplePMGRC2EPK11OSMetaClass` | `0xfffffff0049f003c` | constructor prologue |
| `__ZN9ApplePMGRD2Ev` | `0xfffffff0049f019c` | (sheng binding) |
| `__ZN9ApplePMGR10gMetaClassE` | `0xfffffff006adf490` | (sheng binding) |
| `__ZN9ApplePMGR7readAonEv` | `0xfffffff004a20fbc` | `mov w0,#0; ret; ret` |
| `__ZN9ApplePMGR8writeAonEy` | `0xfffffff004a20fc4` | `ret; mov w0,#0; ret` |
| `_sheng_original_pmgr_nub_create` | `0xfffffff004a22568` | function prologue |
| `_sheng_original_pmgr_nub_read` | `0xfffffff004a24adc` | identical instruction sequence |
| `_sheng_original_pmgr_nub_write` | `0xfffffff004a230ec` | identical instruction sequence |

The ApplePMGR vtable at `0xfffffff005ce26d8` carries the AON stubs in slots 320/321 in this kernel too.
`sheng_pmgr_run()` loads `com.apple.driver.ApplePMGR`, resolves `ApplePMGR`/`ApplePMGRNub` metaclasses,
constructs the subclass, creates the original nub, attaches and registers both services, then checks
`waitForMatchingService("ApplePMGRNub")`.

### Offline SystemOS mount (bring-up)

iOS 17 keeps the dyld shared cache in the SystemOS cryptex, so `launchd` cannot exec without that
volume mounted. XNU already carries an offline owner instrument for exactly this:
`XNU_OWNER_CACHE_MOUNT` calls `native_owner_cache_prepare()` in `load_init_program()`, mounts the
SystemOS APFS volume read-only and hands the init process
`DYLD_SHARED_CACHE_DIR=/private/preboot/System/Library/Caches/com.apple.dyld`.

This board enables it in bring-up mode:

- `CONFIG_XNU_OWNER_CACHE_MOUNT=y`, `CONFIG_XNU_OWNER_CACHE_VOLUME_UUID="8846FE78-2910-4297-AF97-D59BB6F8FC16"`.
  That UUID is the SystemOS APFS volume UUID, read from `APSB` at window offset 18,608,128 and equal
  to the kernel's default.
- DadaUfs provides the two transport hooks (`native_verified_block_volume_device`,
  `native_verified_block_root_authorized`). The lookup matches the IOMedia `UUID` property and returns
  `/dev/diskN`; the authorization verdict is "authorized" because this build carries no signature
  policy.
- `docs/patches/unixnu-owner-cache-bringup.patch` relaxes the build-script gate that otherwise
  requires `XNU_OWNER_ROOT_TRUST=1`.

The mount helper picks the first existing mount point from `/System/Cryptexes/OS`,
`/private/preboot/Cryptexes/OS` and `/private/preboot`, and builds `DYLD_SHARED_CACHE_DIR` from it.
`/System/Cryptexes/OS` and `/private/preboot/Cryptexes/OS` land the volume exactly on the paths the
kernel already probes (`vm_unix.c` `scdir_path`); `zzzzzzz-dada-cache-path.patch` additionally adds
`/private/preboot/System/Library/Caches/com.apple.dyld` so the last resort also maps. The volume lookup matches the
IOMedia `UUID` first and falls back to the SystemOS media size (3,303,014,400 bytes); the device
number comes from a `/dev/<bsd-name>` lookup. If the mount still fails, `load_init_program()` panics
with `offline owner SystemOS mount failed: <errno> stage <n> device <path> mount <errno>`:

| Stage | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| 0 | the root device is not authorized |
| 1 | no SystemOS IOMedia matched the UUID or the size |
| 3 | the APFS `mount()` call failed; the second errno is its result |
| 4 | the mount point did not resolve to the new mount |
| 5/6 | the mounted volume failed the read-only/APFS/device checks |

Common errnos: `ENOENT` (2, mount point missing), `EPERM`/`EAUTH` (1/13), `EINVAL` (22), `ENOTSUP`
(45). This is a DEVELOPMENT-kernel instrument and bypasses the AMFI/owner-policy path.

The initproc panic also carries the instrument state:
`initproc failed to start [cache <stage>/<status> <device> p<mask> lib:<names> <src>:<names>]`. A missing suffix means the booted
kernel is not this build; `[cache 6/0 /dev/...]` means the SystemOS mount and authorization succeeded.
The hex mask records which cache layout exists under the mount point: bit `1` is
`System/Library/Caches/com.apple.dyld/dyld_shared_cache_arm64e`, `2` is
`System/Library/dyld/dyld_shared_cache_arm64e`, `4` is
`System/Cryptexes/OS/System/Library/Caches/com.apple.dyld/dyld_shared_cache_arm64e`. `p0` means none of
the three paths exists, so the file lives elsewhere; the trailing comma-separated names are the first
directory entries of the mounted volume root, which identify the real layout, and `h<hex>` is the first 24 raw bytes of the readdir buffer so the
dirent layout can be decoded exactly. The APFS readdir buffer on this build uses the 32-bit entry
layout (`u32 d_ino, u16 d_reclen, u8 d_type, u8 d_namlen, char d_name[]`), which the listing parser
now matches. The marker lists `System/Library` as `lib:` and then either `dyld:`
(`System/Library/dyld`) or `caches:` (`System/Library/Caches/com.apple.dyld`), so the real cache
file names are visible. `DYLD_SHARED_CACHE_DIR` follows the mask. Launchd got past dyld and failed in
`sandbox_get_container_expected()`, so `com.apple.security.sandbox` was added to the prelink roots; the
prelinker then pulled in `com.apple.driver.AppleMobileFileIntegrity` and `com.apple.driver.ApplePMGR`
as its dependencies (27 components, AMFI and PMGR finally prelinked). The SystemOS volume carries
`System/Library/Caches/com.apple.dyld/dyld_shared_cache_arm64e` (plus arm64 and `.01`..`.03`
fragments), but dyld looks that up under the root, so the mounted-at-a-side-path arrangement cannot
work. `CONFIG_XNU_OWNER_CACHE_STARTUP=y` and `CONFIG_XNU_OWNER_UNION_SYSTEMOS=y` make the kernel mount
the cryptex at `/` with `MNT_UNION`, which is how the original system composes the volume and what puts
the cache on dyld's first search path.

## Open measurements (in order of need)

1. **SMEM RAM table** → a usable `owned_memory_size` and a `dram_size` that reflects the fragmented map.
2. **Platform seed** → `--unique-chip-id` (not stored in any repository).
3. **Trust cache bundles** the board accepts → `[payload] trust_cache_sha256`.
4. **Root volume UUID** → `[payload.adt] root_match_volume_uuid`.
5. **UFS root path**: the compatible match and the SM8750 GCC offsets are corrected in this
   repository's `drivers/DadaUfs` fork (`docs/ufs-dada.md`), checked by
   `drivers/DadaUfs/tests/check_sm8750_facts.py`, and run by the firmware preflight. The transport
   adopts the controller, reads the whole GPT and publishes the linux window; the root image mounts
   and launchd execs. What is still unqualified is block verification (owner policy) and the SMMU
   takeover / QMP v4 sun PHY state / ICE configuration, which remain assumptions.
6. **`xiaomi,dada` platform expert** in XNU: a `drivers/` module for this board, built against the XNU
   compile records. `DadaUfs` matches the UFS controller through `ArmDTPlatform`, which is generic.

Closed: the GPT `userdata` window, the splash region, and the UFS controller compatible / SM8750 clock
offsets (see above and `docs/ufs-dada.md`).

## UFS

| Item | Value | Source |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Controller | `ufshc@1d84000`, `reg` `0x3000` | stock DT |
| `compatible` | `qcom,ufshc` (generic only) | stock DT |
| PHY | `ufsphy_mem@1d80000`, `qcom,ufs-phy-qmp-v4-sun` | stock DT |
| GCC UFS branches | SM8750 offsets in `drivers/DadaUfs/GccUfs.h` | `gcc-sm8750.c` |

The stock tree names the controller `qcom,ufshc` alone. The sheng port matched only
`qcom,sm8550-ufshc`, so the driver never attached to dada. `DadaUfs` now accepts only `qcom,ufshc` and
`qcom,sm8750-ufshc`; see `docs/ufs-dada.md` for the accepted names, the SM8750 clock offsets and what
is still assumed.

Reads are served without owner verification for this first boot: `NATIVE_VERIFIED_BLOCK` is not defined,
so `NativeUfsBlock::start()` returns `true` instead of `configureVerification()`. With the macro defined
and no policy bundle the driver refuses with `policy count invalid` and never publishes the device. See
*Kernel build* above for the builder that controls this.

Only the verifying path is guarded, not the read timer: `native_ufs_read_ticks` and `timerTicks()` are
declared outside the `#if`, because `doAsyncReadWrite()` times every transport read whether or not the
window is authenticated. `scripts/tests/check-kernel-archives.py` keeps that split: it reads the
preprocessor structure of `drivers/*/*.cpp` and fails if a symbol declared only under
`NATIVE_VERIFIED_BLOCK` is used outside the guard. A plain build with the declaration inside failed the
archive compile with three `use of undeclared identifier` errors.

## Other paths seen on the phone

From the mainline Linux work in `dada-uefi.md`: the ESP is `/dev/sda35`, the Linux rootfs
`/dev/sda36`, and the UEFI boot path expects `EFI/BOOT/BOOTAA64.EFI`. Those are **not** the UniXNU
userdata window and are listed only because they are easy to confuse with it.
